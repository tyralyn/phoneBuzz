SERVER/HOSTING/CREDENTIALS INFO

In order to sub in different Twilio account credentials, open up crendentials.py. The from number is set to Twilio's approved test number. Edit the variables accordingly in the following manner: 

sid="aaaaaaaaaaaa"
authToken="bbbbbbbbbbb"

callFrom="+15005550006"

Currently, the site is hosted on an ngrok tunnel to my personal machine. It is currently located at http://8b4cd4ed.ngrok.io/. Please let me know if the tunnel has collapsed (email: tyralyntran@gmail.com) and I'll resolve the issue.

ERRORS/FUTURE WORK

* Delay makes the website hang. In the future, implement multithreading to manage this issue so that a user can queue many calls in the scheduler

* Handle phone input of *: the user inputting a star results in error and hangup. Gather method doesn't SEEM to support this, according to the official Twilio pages -- I will look into this.
